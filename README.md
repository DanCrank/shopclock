RPi-based workshop assistant

Starting off as a clock / info display for my workshop.
I hope to eventually add a voice assistant.

This project uses:
  pygame (https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
  OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api)
  Tweepy (https://tweepy.readthedocs.io)

and possibly may eventually use:
  https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft/picroft

TODO:
  - Improve twitter tile
  - Status bar icons at the bottom?
    - Email waiting
    - Twitter notifications
  - More tile types
    - Pi status (combine RAM & CPU utilization with CPU temperature)
  - Script to install as service

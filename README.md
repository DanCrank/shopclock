RPi-based workshop assistant

Starting off as a clock / info display for my workshop.
I hope to eventually add a voice assistant.

This project uses OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api)
and eventually (possibly) https://www.home-assistant.io/.

TODO:
  - Status bar icons
    - Email waiting
    - Twitter notifications
  - More tile types
    - Weather forecast (add icons)
    - Recent tweets
  - Load tile list from config file
  - Make center tile bigger (let them overlap?)
  - Script to install as service

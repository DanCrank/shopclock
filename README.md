RPi-based workshop assistant

Starting off as a clock / info display for my workshop.
I hope to eventually add a voice assistant.

This project uses:
  OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api)
  guizero (https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/)
  Pillow (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)
and eventually (possibly)
  https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft/picroft

TODO:
  - Status bar icons
    - Email waiting
    - Twitter notifications
  - More tile types
    - Weather forecast
    - Recent tweets
  - Script to install as service
